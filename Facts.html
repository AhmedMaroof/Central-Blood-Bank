                                      A blood type is considered rare if fewer than 1 in 1,000 people have them. One of the rarest blood types in the world is Rh-null, which lack any antigens in the Rh system.<br>
                                      There are only 9 active donors in the community of rare blood donors that have Rh-null blood.<br>
                                      Rh-null is considered a universal blood for anyone with a rare blood type within the Rh system. However, anyone who has Rh-null blood can only receive Rh-null blood in a transfusion.

                            As confirmed by naturopath Peter J. D’Adamo, various blood types result in varying nutritional needs.
                            People with Type O blood tend to have digestion and stomach problems. As such, they require a high-protein diet with plenty of lean meat, poultry, fish and vegetables.

                           Type A blood causes the body to react badly to specific foods like dairy, meat and shellfish.
                            <br>That reaction makes it difficult to lose belly fat.<br>
                           It also causes acid reflux, an increase in diabetes risk, bloating and indigestion.
